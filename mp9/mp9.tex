I created a file named {\tt convert\_to\_arff.py} to convert the data that is located in the file {\tt MP9-1.arff}.
Both are located in this repository.

I would have the signals from the sensors and motor control log output into a text file at a given time step (\~ .2s is probably good).
I would then use a file similar to my {\tt convert\_to\_arff.py} from problem 1 which would preprocess the data for use in something like WEKA.
This would produce a symbolic regressor, as the motor control takes the form of a class, not a numerical value.
The documentation mentions that the drive motors operate at a constant speed, so this is why it is classification (L or R motor Forward or Backward).
The ROS on the turtlebot would differ in the fact that there are different sensors than in the data we have above.
I would implement the neural network then, into the ROS and use it to drive the robot.
